Allow survey to be changed?

Household surveys/Assets/Alternative energy sources
    Status of entity collection does not update when all children entities are corrected
    Title show up twice

Remove attribute from collection

Conversion of coordinates

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1676958/coordinate-transform

Integer/Double Unit
Boolean
Range
Loading code list blocks UI Thread

Validate required fields when record/entity is added
Names of entities
    Name show up twice sometimes
    Code labels not available when record/entity is added

Don't restart after crash


--------

Relevance of internal nodes
    Relevant if any child nodes are relevant

Checkbox
    We can actually get validation error on AttributeCollection
        Checking too many boxes
        But, there is an empty attribute created by default
    When making irrelevant then relevant, wrong checks
    Required label not showing up when required but none checked

Input components
    Boolean
    Coordinate srs id
    Units of numbers
    Integer range
    Double range

Enumerated entity
    Attribute names sometimes show up twice in entity String representation
        Household Survey/General/Control information
    Code label not loaded when code never been set, but defaulted

Radio buttons - none selected option?
    So it value is unknown, user can reset the component

Remove record/entity/attribute

Validation when adding record/entity

Unique validation working?

Re-implement RecordDao using the node database
    Needed for record key uniqueness checks

Node pattern message

Label of code attributes when adding record/entity is null
    CodeConverter
        Solve this when rendering the an enumerated entity collection? Ugly but should work.


Disable code component when parent not selected
    Radio-group is empty, but need text
    Auto-complete is shown - should be hidden or disabled

----------------------------

Large code lists - search db

----------------------------

Setting region is slow
    added temporary caching - fix properly

Text when multiplicity but no items

Enumerated entity - attributes show up twice in entity String representation

Move keyToDefinitionId to separate Definition subtype

Don't show scrollbar when scrolling breadcrumbs programmatically

UiCodeAdapter
    Use CodeListService to search for items given a query - complete code list not needed

Don't import/load survey on main thread

Load CodeListManager.loadValidItems too slow
Speed up cluster selection

Entity name show up twice  - plot/soil/layers

Show attribute/entity description

Clean up UI model - confusing
    UiNode.init()
    UiNode.register()
    UiSurvey.addRecord()
    UiRecord with and without placeholder in constructor

Attributes with multiple
    code -> checkboxes
    text -> multiple text fields on screen
    date, time ?

Taxon

Name of entities (with multiplicity) without any key (time study)

Include unit, precision for integer and real attributes

Default attribute value

Attribute states: N/A, blank

Code lists: Qualifier - the other option

Code lists: Prevent unique constraint violation - disable options
    When attribute is key, disable values selected in other attributes with same definition id
        Who keeps track on the set of selected values for a definition?
    Checkboxes?

Validation error notification menu

Prevent from adding too many entities/attributes

Remove record/entity/attribute

How to distinguish between unsaved "default value" and a saved value? Prevent saving default value
    Problem with date picker, time picker etc.

Use styles, not hard-coded padding etc.

Next attribute button
    What should happen in the multi-entity case? Should next go back to NodeAttribute?

Attribute details popover
    Show the parents, and values of parents

Indicate in attribute list if attribute is simple attribute, single or multiple node attribute
    Different icons

In attribute/entity list, let each item have a "status ball"
    green - filled
    yellow - incomplete
    red - validation error

Lock button

Figure out how to get log output from physical device
Measure times
