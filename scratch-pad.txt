Re-implement RecordDao using the node database?
    Needed for uniqueness checks

More components
    Time and date as EditText with pop-up

Radio buttons - none selected option?
    So it value is unknown, user can reset the component


Remove record/entity/attribute

Validation when adding record/entity

Irrelevant attributes

----------------------------

Setting region is slow
    added temporary caching - fix properly
    try to override more methods in CodeListDao


When changing record key attribute (Measurement in Cluster Details)
    Check for uniqueness is made - RecordManager uses RecordDao do do this

Validate attributes when adding record/entity, so required attributes show up red
    Manage required validation our self? Add required flag on AttributeDefinition, and check if empty?

Set status to OK whenever an attribute is irrelevant


Text when multiplicity but no items

Enumerated entity - attributes show up twice in entity String representation

Move keyToDefinitionId to separate Definition subtype

Don't show scrollbar when scrolling breadcrumbs programmatically

UiCodeAdapter
    Use CodeListService to search for items given a query - complete code list not needed

Don't import/load survey on main thread

Load CodeListManager.loadValidItems too slow
Speed up cluster selection

Entity name show up twice  - plot/soil/layers

Show attribute/entity description

Clean up UI model - confusing
    UiNode.init()
    UiNode.register()
    UiSurvey.addRecord()
    UiRecord with and without placeholder in constructor

Attributes with multiple
    code -> checkboxes
    text -> multiple text fields on screen
    date, time ?

Taxon

Name of entities (with multiplicity) without any key (time study)

Include unit, precision for integer and real attributes

Default attribute value

Attribute states: N/A, blank

Code lists: Qualifier - the other option

Code lists: Prevent unique constraint violation - disable options
    When attribute is key, disable values selected in other attributes with same definition id
        Who keeps track on the set of selected values for a definition?
    Checkboxes?

Validation error notification menu

Prevent from adding too many entities/attributes

Remove record/entity/attribute

How to distinguish between unsaved "default value" and a saved value? Prevent saving default value
    Problem with date picker, time picker etc.

Use styles, not hard-coded padding etc.

Next attribute button
    What should happen in the multi-entity case? Should next go back to NodeAttribute?

Attribute details popover
    Show the parents, and values of parents

Indicate in attribute list if attribute is simple attribute, single or multiple node attribute
    Different icons

In attribute/entity list, let each item have a "status ball"
    green - filled
    yellow - incomplete
    red - validation error

Lock button

Figure out how to get log output from physical device
Measure times


----------------------------------------------------------------

Risks
-----
Attributes with multiple values

Relevant nodes

Code list size

Unique constraints on codes - who keeps track of the set of selected values?
